  had to be within the range [-100, 1000]. To get the numbers generated by Math.random() to be between -100 and 1000,
  the maximum was multiplied by Math.random(). Since javascript is 0-indexed, if we set the maximum to 1000,
  then Math.random() will only produce values up to 999. To generate numbers up to 1000, 1001 had to be set as the maximum
  because of, again, zero indexing.
  Then, the minimum value, -100, was added to the product of Math.random()* 1001. Doing these operations
  will bring every number between 0 and 1 generated by the Math.random() function to be between the ranges of -100 to 1000.
  Then, the toFixed() method was used. The toFixed() method converts a number to a string and keeps only
  a certain number of decimals. In this line, the parameter of the toFixed() method is 2,
  meaning that when the random number generated is put into this method, only 2 decimal points will be kept.
  Finally, since the toFixed() method converts a number to a string, the string generated by the toFixed()
